@cnnbrk The Quran calls for the execution of who ever insults their prophet. They are doing what their hateful religion tells them to do.
@cnnbrk Today we mourn with France but in the weeks to come France needs to do some soul searching and introspection
‚Äú@cnnbrk: At least 12 killed in today's attack on satirical magazine #CharlieHebdo in Paris, official says. http://t.co/eS87lPU9Of‚Äù
@cnnbrk Also security was abysmal and should have been heightened when so many threats had already happened towards this media agency
@cnnbrk Western leaders created terrorists with various Arabic "springs" by  mercenaries jihadists.It was INEVITABLE to go west.
@cnnbrk disturbing.
@cnnbrk it was time . Cause no respect for any religion. If talk about Jews . It's anti semite.  If abuse Islam freedom of religionDeserve
@cnnbrk insulting others people faith cannot be called freedom of speech. Chief editor is one to blame. I Do not justify monsters-jail them
@cnnbrk Islamic terror. Empowered by media that makes excuses for it. Can't blame the Jews 4 this CNN. THIS is Islam
@HomefrontHugs @cnnbrk and lots of deportation
@cnnbrk if state cannot control such irresponsible magazines making fun of people's faith then monsters come and do thejob.Face consequences
@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk Jews don't kill anyone if offended. Christians don't. Only these disgusting excuses for human beings. It's a CARTOON!
@cnnbrk Remember background: France, its Parliament &amp; Senate + some left-wgd municipalities bending over backwards to please Palestinians..
@cnnbrk prophet moohammadd bedded horses,nothing more nothing less
@HomefrontHugs @cnnbrk In France all Jewish official buldings including schools have to be tightly secured. Can't have police everywhere...
@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk dif between satire &amp; hatred. No Islamic sense of humor. Jihadists don't know what free speech means
@GDANIELDS @cnnbrk the real problem was letting these moooslims into the free world.ask politicans why we need them .moohammadd bedded MR.ED
@zhuravkov67 @cnnbrk satire. Get it? Insults r free speech. Cowardice &amp; murder r not. Islamic terror is celebrated by its followers
@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk islam is not a religion its a brainwashed cult.
@keller_lind @cnnbrk true but when you mock a religion every day - one should heighten security
@keller_lind @cnnbrk Hearts and prayers for families of these police and journalists
@HomefrontHugs @cnnbrk CH mocks all religions. Only one replies with assault rifles. + there were policement there. Killed too.
@DaliaChai @cnnbrk u go to jail for anti semite.  Law. U can abuse any religion it's called freedom of speech. Be fair. It's hurtful
@keller_lind @cnnbrk There is no excuse - it is unacceptable always - we know in America how it feels
@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk they are discusting animals
@signlab9 @cnnbrk hehehe yah like Judaism Christianity and worst hinduism. This is what fools in churches call it. Because they are afraid
@zhuravkov67 @cnnbrk Hey buddy, I'm insulting your faith. Now go fuck yourself.
@DaliaChai @cnnbrk what freedom when you abuse a religion. These guys are freedom fighters for protecting Islam.  Why no law protect religio
@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk anti semitism, inciting hatred is VERY dif than satire&amp;humor. Jews don't kill u forcartoon. Inciting hate tho is crime
@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk but the priests,rabbis&amp; ministers don't preach(kill all non moooslims)  not yet  but lets hope we get it on.easy prey.
@Mariodinava @DaliaChai @cnnbrk Muslims feel they r being attacked everywhere not even their religion. These tend to happen. No protection
@DaliaChai @cnnbrk what more hatred u want after abusing n Makin fun of the prophet. These guys who drew created hatred. Not attackers
@theprawnatron @cnnbrk stay stupid and wait be the next victim.   such trash like u cannot blame monsters. U deserve be punished by monsters
@hassanbasmer Muslims are being persecuted for their religion? In Pakistan, Nigeria or Paris? @DaliaChai @cnnbrk #CharlieHebdo
@hassanbasmer I have to say though, the honesty about the murderous tenets of your religion is refreshing. @DaliaChai @cnnbrk #CharlieHebdo
@Chusid2015 @DaliaChai @cnnbrk hehe u Jews are good by changing subjects.open another topic. We are talking of anti semitsm and anti islam
@DaliaChai @cnnbrk u r not getting my point -monsters must be penalized.  But entire society need to be responsible and not provoke monsters
@Chusid2015 @DaliaChai @cnnbrk look you fool we are talking revenge. If u abuse any religion . Revenge will be taken that simple
@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk free speech. They made fun of everyone! Only islamics kill ppl for a joke. A cartoon. A little offense. No excuse
@hassanbasmer @Mariodinava @cnnbrk Bcoz they r killing people! Slaughtering. 'In the name of their prophet' no one else is doing that.
@hassanbasmer @Mariodinava @cnnbrk its not islamaphobia to call an Islamic terrorist what he is. Muslims r silent &amp; won't stand up
@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk freedom fighters?? Fighting AGAINST everyone else's freedom. Go away
@DaliaChai @cnnbrk that's the problem. Muslims are serious in their only and one true religion. They won't abuse of jesus moses or mohammed
@hassanbasmer yeah? I'd like to see you respond this way to anti-Semitic children's programs on Gaza tv @DaliaChai @cnnbrk
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk anti semitism results in ppl killing Jews. But Jews don't slaughter anyone for offensive cartoons
@zhuravkov67 @cnnbrk infidels that r breathing offends these monsters. Freedom offends them.
@DaliaChai @Mariodinava @cnnbrk sorry not in name of Prophet.  In the name of God. Ezra to Jews is son of God. Just u guys r idol worship
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk BS. NO other religion teaches that it's great to kill everyone else for whatever stupid reason islamics do
@Chusid2015 @DaliaChai @cnnbrk you fool . We r not talking of Gaza. Anti semitsm and no laws anti protection of islam
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk thanks tho for being honest about the Islamic excuses for murder
@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer don't think any1 is having trouble understanding what this is about. Kind if silly to compare this to anti-Semitism
@Chusid2015 @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk no it's ok to offend everyone else. Precious pedophile needs to be protected
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai @cnnbrk why are we not talking of Gaza, ya sidi?
@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk yes because islam is true religion. They don't take Bullshit from fools like Charlie Have died.
@hassanbasmer @cnnbrk pathetic waste of air. Thanks for showing the excuse for Islamic butchery
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai lol the true all-embracing, multicultural attitude of "moderate" Islam comes out
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk freedom of speech protects everyone. Islam just doesn't believe in freedom or democracy. Just death
@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk pedophiles is accepted in Judaism.  Read torah.  Who gave these fools right to make fun of Islam
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk well if murder, pedophilia &amp; hate is ur true religion, then u deserve the hatred &amp; offense u get! Done w/u
@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk where is Islam protected under freedom of speech.  Show me any law. No law. So these guys right to kill
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai lol moron I'm a rabbinical student. Don't tell me to find non existent things in the Torah
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk it is a disgrace in Judaism. And christianity. It's applauded in Islam. Child rape pretending 2 b marriage
@DaliaChai @cnnbrk reason forthis massacre is a concrete action of paper.not general principles of freedom.
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai but it seems clear that you agree that the legitimate #Islamic response to the #CharlieHebdo satire was murder. üò∂
@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk hatred pedophile and disgrace in Judaism . We as Muslims don't accept . What freedom if abuse Islam. Death
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai do you live in an actual tent? And is your name Saladin or something
@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk come on Rabbis have wives as young as six. Hehehe. What is that not rape and pedophiles
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk go away. Sorry excuse for human
@Chusid2015 @DaliaChai hehe Jews always change subject. If they lose cause of truth. Be serious. How many died under you in israel
@zhuravkov67 @cnnbrk no it was Islamic teaching that freedom of speech is offensive to Islam, but killing is just dandy
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai I have a lamp that I will sell you. If you rub it long enough a genie will emerge and grant you three wishes
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk civilized countries have civilized laws that protect everyone. Islamics don't get 2 murder &amp; say defense
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai heh heh Muslims always full of crap. What alternate universe you live in
@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk what civilization.  If you can abuse a religion and no law to protect any religion. So Muslims are guardians
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 11million arabs/Muslims killed by arab/Muslims since 1948. U r offended by eachother
@DaliaChai @cnnbrk u r better expert.  I doubt but I am not expert.If so than my question why western govts tolerate all those Muslim groups
‚Äú@DaliaChai: @hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 11million arabs/Muslims killed by arab/Muslims since 1948. U r offended by eachother‚Äù @darjaved7
@DaliaChai @Chusid2015 don't make up stories. That is the way of Jews.  Always lying. There is it media . You cannot hide and lie. Killers
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai @cnnbrk I dont believe in any of them and certainly not worship them
@darjaved7 @DaliaChai @hassanbasmer  yup and all those Jews slaughtering kids in Pakistan and kidnapping schoolgirls in Nigeria
@hassanbasmer @DaliaChai I feel that the intellectual level of this discourse has kinda gone to hell
@Chusid2015 @darjaved7 @DaliaChai no in Gaza and west banks. In pakistan Nigeria and Israel Netanyahu are same no difference
@Chusid2015 @DaliaChai easy just accept the truth and accept. You see abuse people not religion any where in the world. All religions
@darjaved7 @DaliaChai @hassanbasmer  this may come as a surprise to you but we and our fellow Jews...don't run the USA
@hassanbasmer @Mariodinava @DaliaChai @cnnbrk yeah i feel really sorry for them
@hassanbasmer @darjaved7 @DaliaChai not sure what ur referring to. When Hamas brutally eliminates its rivals? Or uses kids as human shields
@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer  arrggh! Can't... Defeat... The blinding light of @darjaved7 's logic!!
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @darjaved7 depraved &amp; stupid. Go away
@darjaved7 @Chusid2015 islamics don't let us close our eyes. Ur too busy killing everyone. Even eachother
@darjaved7 @hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk lol. The ones that were faked? No pal massacres. No pal genocide. None of it is fact. Fool
@darjaved7 @Chusid2015 @hassanbasmer Hamas showed up in 1980s. Islamics sided WITH Hitler. Please read something truthful. U know nothing
@darjaved7 @Chusid2015 @hassanbasmer &amp; hurler didn't kick Jews out. He murdered them. That is what a real genocide is. Now go away. Done w/u
@DaliaChai @darjaved7 @Chusid2015 ohhh so Hitler genocide and in Gaza not massacre.  Be truthful. U Jews always lie. Face the truth n justic
@darjaved7 @DaliaChai @Chusid2015 bro thats hate not jews are bad I think its the zionist and far right who want to kill anyone who opposes
@mohamudaish @darjaved7 @DaliaChai appreciate your attempt at open-mindedness. But...keep trying
@mohamudaish @darjaved7 @DaliaChai although violent extremism in any form is undoubtedly bad. No matter which religion. We can agree on that
@signlab9 @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk so is free speach
@mohamudaish @darjaved7 @DaliaChai nor do I believe all Muslims are bad. I have encountered many friendly Muslims here in Israel
@mohamudaish but we must keep our dialogue honest. Appreciate you reaching out. Don't be afraid of "Zionists" they're not out to get you
@signlab9 @GDANIELDS @cnnbrk u imposed dictators stole raw material both in africa and middle east
@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk also in the creation of the zionist state it was a norm for jews to dress up as muslims and bomb people
@DaliaChai @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk u heard it from me no muslim unless brainwashed will kill innocent people even if u abuse prophet
@mohamudaish @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk settle down just came back from emirates,arabs r just fine its these brainwashed moooslims that r cause
@mohamudaish @GDANIELDS @cnnbrk we stole it,ur shieks got all the money &amp; enslaved u &amp; ur women folk attack them u cowards.
@Chusid2015 @mohamudaish @darjaved7 totally agree @chusid2015! Fortunately there are many not like this 'revenge' seeker
@mohamudaish @darjaved7 @Chusid2015 that's ridiculous. Arabs in Israel r safe. Not so for ones that try to murder Israelis. Now move along
@mohamudaish @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk go away. It's what arabs do
@mohamudaish @hassanbasmer @cnnbrk lots &amp; lots brainwashed then. Seeing ur comments shows how widespread
@theprawnatron @cnnbrk you,baboon,  US media rejected to reprint those pictures finding them insulting.So go and fuck yourself u stupid boy
@zhuravkov67  Hey buddy, I'm still insulting your faith and there's nothing you can do about it. Now go fuck yourself, loser.

@Colvinius @LePoint A tragedy.
@Colvinius @SuzanneCarbone @JulieOMarshall @LePoint no blood, just hear the shouting. I don't post any videos where u see blood or killing
@Colvinius @IrinaGalushkoRT @LePoint Shit! " le grand Duduche" was my youth...
@Red4Mira @MartinRJay See my previous tweets. That's what Charlie Hebdo does. Latest cover savages an ANTI-Muslim writer - and Jesus.
@Colvinius @IrinaGalushkoRT @LePoint Assassins did recon, knew victim names/faces, according to witnesses.
@Colvinius @MartinRJay  What I mean is that they know Muslims take no jokes when it's related to their religion, book or prophet. Why do it?
@russianinusofa @Colvinius @LePoint as evidenced by the fact they killed 3 cartoonists - not just random people
@Red4Mira @MartinRJay Because *not* to do it for any religion creates a class of people who can't be criticised.
@nancysaidboo Exactly. @Colvinius @meadea @LePoint
@Red4Mira @MartinRJay In other words, satire isn't satire and free speech isn't free speech if some people are 'beyond ridicule'.
@Colvinius @Red4Mira true but there's a huge difference between being criticized and satirized, no?
@Colvinius @MartinRJay  It's not a matter of criticism, it's insulting and demeaning and offensive
@MartinRJay @Red4Mira So Jon Stewart, John Oliver, Colbert, Private Eye all fair game? Freedom of speech includes ridicule.
@Red4Mira @MartinRJay Good satire often is. Their latest cover attacks an ANTI-Muslim writer - and Jesus: http://t.co/HwPsFsLCje
@Colvinius @MartinRJay  Freedom of speech shud never mean to give the press the right to trash others or ruin others image just bec they CAN
@Red4Mira @MartinRJay So your answer to my question is yes. Enough said. Bye.
@Colvinius @Red4Mira yes freedom of speech is v broad but some cultures r behind the anglo saxons on self criticism, that's all.

@SkyNews find them. catch them. hang them publicly. send the message out zero tolerance will be shown. they don't deserve any humanity....
@SkyNews Find them, torture them to fuck, then leave them out in the open tied up for the public to finish them off.
@SkyNews Freedom of speech !!!!!  http://t.co/rTuk7BdFEw
@SkyNews little shits are just using religion to go around murdering innocent people because they are uneducated no-good thugs #scumbags
@SkyNews why have these worthless pricks not been taken out yet ?
"@SkyNews: The #CharlieHebdo attack suspects have reportedly fired shots while robbing a petrol station http://t.co/tsAnzcpItl #Thieves
@SkyNews deluded thieving extremists, folks just need to read the right books and stay off drugs! #CharlesHebdo
@SkyNews Why is the term racism used when muslims try to justify acts of terrorism? Islam is a religion not a race.
@SkyNews Best to shot to kill the muslim shits!!
@SkyNews I hope they catch these cowards alive so they can face justice.

@juliamacfarlane maybe they want to get caught
@juliamacfarlane I think they ultimately want their day in court and a platform upon which the world will look.
@juliamacfarlane +1
@juliamacfarlane In one respect; part of me hopes they give the French armed police a legitimate reason.....
.@juliamacfarlane "Highly trained" by secret services‚Ä¶
@juliamacfarlane The two left the ID of an probably innocent 18 yr old to try to put the Police off their track.
@juliamacfarlane A "highly trained" member of my troop lost a pair of &gt;¬£2000 night vision goggles once.
@juliamacfarlane @fattysaid Really? Is that confirmed?
@juliamacfarlane Well.... http://t.co/0SDPHO1zJM
@juliamacfarlane @AmericaHipple Maybe they were convinced they would die? Just guessing
@juliamacfarlane @dangillmor classic misdirection. Probably seals or MI6.
@juliamacfarlane As they say, smartest criminals make mistakes too!
@juliamacfarlane @dangillmor Unless you've got military experience, its hard to understand how much stress your brain undergoes in battle.
@juliamacfarlane @dandrezner Highly trained doesn't necessarily mean always smart.
@juliamacfarlane @petedavo_world Maybe the gunmen were better trained than the getaway driver? #weakestlink
@juliamacfarlane @AmericaHipple video also shows them using some not so great skills in the street (crossing each other's line of fire, etc)
@juliamacfarlane @auddin76 I suspect they were rather distracted. Can't think why...
@juliamacfarlane don't ask too many questions someone might accuse you of being a journalist
@juliamacfarlane how about the story that friends of the third suspect Hamyd saw him in class 230km away during the attack
@copiesofcopies @juliamacfarlane @dangillmor you can't be serious
@amuse OK. But why precisely an ID, why not Seresta tablets? @juliamacfarlane @dangillmor
@hussain_aadil @juliamacfarlane @dangillmor it is not inconceivable that the terrorists were on anti-anxiety meds AND were amp'd.
@fangbreaker i could be, but I'm not. @juliamacfarlane @dangillmor
@copiesofcopies @juliamacfarlane @dangillmor sometimes it's hard to tell
@milnews_ca @juliamacfarlane The answer will probably start with "S".Stupid, or Staged and depends on Smart.;)
@amuse @juliamacfarlane @dangillmor These men were clearly military trained...
@Techpaste @juliamacfarlane @dangillmor the bullet groupings were super tight for automatic fire...
@amuse @juliamacfarlane @dangillmor exactly. Something which isn't achieved through a day at the shooting range...
I am still confused as to why these "highly trained" individuals left their ID in the getaway car. #CharlieHebdo

@kwjpn @NBCNews they want to be killed they want to be martyrs that would fuel them... Capture them and isolate them In prison
@TopoC the only reason why u don't kill them at this point is if u think they have info about future terrorist attacks.
@Y_I_S_C no they want to be martyrs they want to be killed it makes them Heroes to the other terrorists
@TopoC they are heroes to their followers no matter what. Don't give them a way to get out instructions to trigger future attacks.
@Y_I_S_C I don't think they are leaders  the leaders don't do the real terrorism... But I get what you are saying tho
@TopoC they could be middle managers. They could lead a group.
@Y_I_S_C they were sick of the dead end job so they went postal... Zing! Lol sorry
@NBCNews what cowards . Good will always conquer evil
@TopoC @NBCNews Well, that's a good idea too. But...they're gonna end up life in prison and that means that they're gonna live on taxes...

@BklynMiddleton rumors say hostages are 1 women and 4 childrens---
@BklynMiddleton sorrow is not the emotion one should have at this stage. maybe afterwards. right now, it's appropriate to be filled w rage
@BklynMiddleton is it just a coincidence that kosher market thing or a missibg part of the picture ?
RT @BklynMiddleton: An 11-month old baby is among the hostages at the Kosher supermarket in #ParisAttack
@BklynMiddleton @paytheline11 Some people can control their "rage" enough to make and think logically, even at times like this.
@BklynMiddleton if you're not angry that jihadists are taking 11month old hostages you're doing something wrong. be honest, you are
@paytheline11 Maybe you should scroll through my tweets.
@BklynMiddleton really sad. Ever seen fotos of gaza babies ? All babies r equal i suppose
@BklynMiddleton i'll get right on that
*Mutes Universe*
@BklynMiddleton The pause button is broken and there is no rewind function.It's terrifying when you think about it.
@BklynMiddleton it's a dialogue isn't it? please don't take my comment as attacking. i am not sad.. yet. im stark raving mad.
@BklynMiddleton It's that kind of day. The kind where you want to go back to bed with some fiction to distract.
@pptsapper Or the day you wonder why you didn't just study creative writing and adopt some nice cats in Vermont.... or something.
@BklynMiddleton I could become a novelist and live in the woods of northern Maine...with no internet. And ditto cat(s)
@Jon_Startin @BklynMiddleton they are better people than most then.  because this is not worthy of sorrow IMO. it should make you angry
@BklynMiddleton u r among the only journalists saying kosher market &amp; not calling it something generic. If it's kosher it was targeted. Thx
@PD28 @BklynMiddleton Hashtag #kosher shows lots of journalists are referring to it as a kosher supermarket.
@BklynMiddleton can i borrow your universal mute button?
@BklynMiddleton rather than being a 'lone-wolf copy-cat' the fact the attacker is so well-armed points to a far more worrying escalation.
@tsrosenberg @BklynMiddleton that's my mistake. Thanks!
@PD28 @BklynMiddleton No problem! Wish it weren't such a horrible situation.

@ShirazMaher @intelwire Not so much separated. There're links between them.
@JeromePio @intelwire meant it in the sense that it's different person/people. Links between them unclear at the moment, lots of rumours.
@ShirazMaher @NickKristof no dead ! cf @Place_Beauvau
@ShirazMaher @JeromePio A lot of shifting sands in the coverage right now. We'll know soon enough.
@ShirazMaher @JeromePio Speaking of https://t.co/lCQ0qFyePh
@intelwire @ShirazMaher Absolutly right.
@ShirazMaher @NickKristof Police have just confirmed the connection on http://t.co/xQEFWPVehi
@ShirazMaher @NickKristof what a shocker..
@ShirazMaher @DimaV Yes there is a link. It was confirmed officially today.
@intelwire @ShirazMaher @JeromePio Yes lots of mixed info coming out. Anyone else here about potential 08 prison connection btwn planners?
@ShirazMaher so what happen to the Charlie hebbdo suspects man news coverage is so shifty in this story
@cldaymon @intelwire @ShirazMaher Previous connections about plot to freed a terrorist involved in 1995 Paris attack. Otherwise not yet.
@rachelfromohio @ShirazMaher Officials have apparently confirmed that the deli is linked to #CharlieHebdo &amp; killing of officer.
@JeromePio Thanks 4 the clarification. Many ideas being floated by the media right now. Wish they wouldn't do this. @intelwire @ShirazMaher
@cldaymon @intelwire @ShirazMaher Honestly, we need to wait official statement and investigations. By now, we all talk about rumors. :)
@JeromePio Agreed. As we say here in the States, "hold your horses". Lol! @intelwire @ShirazMaher
@ShirazMaher @NickKristof It is a separate incident but the same #terrorist cell?
@ShirazMaher @NickKristof Are moderate #Muslims protesting these acts of murder and violence?
@vanemaya @NickKristof That's what the police are saying. I meant 'separate' as in different guys to the ones that did Charlie Hebdo attack.
@ShirazMaher Thank you, Shiraz. I understand. What do you each think about all this? What is your reaction? @NickKristof
@vanemaya I think we don't have enough facts about the big picture right now (AQAP/ISIS etc), we'll need to wait and see  @NickKristof
@ShirazMaher @NickKristof ok. I would like to hear your reactions, your personal thoughts, once you have had time to process these events.
